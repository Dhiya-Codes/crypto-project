# 🔐 Crypto Encoder/Decoder in Python

This is a simple Python project that encrypts and decrypts secret messages using a custom substitution cipher. It’s called *Enigma Light* — a fun beginner-friendly project to learn basic Python concepts like strings, dictionaries, and loops.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Works for lowercase letters, spaces, and !

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A *key string* is created (a-z, space, and !)
2. The *value string* is auto-generated by rotating the key
3. Two dictionaries are created:
   - For encoding: key ➝ value
   - For decoding: value ➝ key
4. Based on user input, the program encodes or decodes the message
